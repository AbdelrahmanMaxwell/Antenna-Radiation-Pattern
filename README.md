# :satellite: Antenna Radiation Pattern 

A Python-based application that helps users visualize the radiation pattern of antennas. This app allows users to input antenna parameters such as gain, frequency, and polarization, and then generates linera and polar representation of the antenna's radiation pattern. The user can also customize the display settings and export the pattern to various image file formats.
